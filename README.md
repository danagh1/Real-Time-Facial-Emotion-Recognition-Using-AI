# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Using-AI (Android App)
Facial emotion recognition (FER) is a technology that analyzes facial expressions from images or videos to identify an individual's emotional state. One of the most important challenges faced by current artificial intelligence (AI) based mobile applications in recognizing facial emotions is bias as there is a lack of representation of faces wearing hijabs and Middle Eastern faces in the databases of faces used in available applications, which leads to inaccurate results of these applications. The proposed project aims to build a real-time emotion analysis application focusing on Middle Eastern faces particularly women wearing hijabs to increase its usability in the Arab world.
The traditional method of emotion recognition may not meet the need of mobile application users for their emerging value-added services, so providing techniques for classifying facial expressions by taking advantage of the benefits of deep learning (DL) is important. We used DL model was trained using the FER2013 dataset and retrained it on a hybrid dataset that includes the Extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) dataset, Japanese female facial expression (JAFFE) dataset, and Iranian emotional face database (IEFDB). We achieved a test accuracy of 88% on the hybrid test set and 90% test accuracy on the IEFDB test set.
